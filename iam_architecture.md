# Identity and Access Management (IAM) Architecture

This document outlines the Identity and Access Management (IAM) architecture for the Sevensa platform. The architecture provides a comprehensive approach to managing identities, authentication, authorization, and access control across all services.

## Overview

The IAM architecture is designed to provide a secure, scalable, and user-friendly identity management solution for the Sevensa platform. It builds upon the Zero-Trust Network Architecture implemented in Phase 2 and extends it with advanced identity management capabilities.

The architecture follows these key principles:

1. **Centralized Identity Management**: Single source of truth for all identities
2. **Federated Authentication**: Support for multiple authentication methods and identity providers
3. **Fine-grained Authorization**: Role-based and attribute-based access control
4. **Multi-factor Authentication**: Enhanced security for sensitive operations
5. **Self-service Capabilities**: User-friendly interfaces for identity management
6. **Audit and Compliance**: Comprehensive logging and reporting

## Architecture Components

### 1. Identity Provider (IdP)

Keycloak serves as the central Identity Provider for the Sevensa platform, providing:

- User management and authentication
- Role and group management
- Federation with external identity providers
- Multi-factor authentication
- Single Sign-On (SSO)
- User self-service

### 2. Secret Management

OpenBao serves as the secret management solution, providing:

- Secure storage of credentials and secrets
- Dynamic secret generation
- Secret rotation
- Access control for secrets
- Audit logging

### 3. API Gateway

The API Gateway provides a unified entry point for all API requests, with:

- Authentication and authorization enforcement
- Token validation and transformation
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Request routing
- Monitoring and logging

### 4. IAM API

The IAM API provides programmatic access to identity and access management functions:

- User management
- Role and permission management
- Group management
- Access control policy management
- Audit and reporting

### 5. Client Libraries

Client libraries provide easy integration with the IAM system for applications:

- Authentication and authorization
- Token management
- User profile access
- Role and permission checking

## Identity Lifecycle

The IAM architecture supports the complete identity lifecycle:

1. **Provisioning**: Creation of user accounts and assignment of initial roles
2. **Authentication**: Verification of user identity
3. **Authorization**: Determination of user permissions
4. **Management**: Updates to user profiles, roles, and permissions
5. **Deprovisioning**: Removal of access when no longer needed

## Authentication Flow

The authentication flow follows these steps:

1. User accesses a service or application
2. User is redirected to the Identity Provider (Keycloak)
3. User authenticates using their credentials
4. If required, multi-factor authentication is performed
5. Upon successful authentication, the Identity Provider issues tokens
6. The user is redirected back to the service with the tokens
7. The service validates the tokens and grants access

## Authorization Model

The authorization model combines Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- **Roles**: Collections of permissions
- **Groups**: Collections of users
- **Role Hierarchy**: Roles can inherit from other roles
- **Role Assignment**: Users are assigned roles directly or through group membership

### Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)

- **User Attributes**: Properties of users (e.g., department, location)
- **Resource Attributes**: Properties of resources (e.g., classification, owner)
- **Environmental Attributes**: Properties of the environment (e.g., time, location)
- **Policies**: Rules that evaluate attributes to make access decisions

## Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

MFA is implemented using a risk-based approach:

- **Low-Risk Operations**: Password only
- **Medium-Risk Operations**: Password + One additional factor
- **High-Risk Operations**: Password + Two additional factors

Supported MFA methods:

- Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP)
- SMS One-Time Password
- Email One-Time Password
- WebAuthn (FIDO2)
- Push notifications

## Single Sign-On (SSO)

SSO is implemented across all services using:

- OpenID Connect (OIDC) for modern web applications
- SAML 2.0 for legacy applications
- OAuth 2.0 for API access

## Federation

The IAM architecture supports federation with external identity providers:

- Corporate Active Directory / LDAP
- Social identity providers (Google, Microsoft, GitHub)
- SAML 2.0 identity providers
- OpenID Connect identity providers

## Audit and Compliance

Comprehensive audit logging is implemented for all identity and access management operations:

- Authentication events
- Authorization decisions
- Administrative actions
- User self-service actions

Audit logs are:

- Tamper-proof
- Searchable
- Exportable
- Retained according to compliance requirements

## Security Considerations

### Token Security

- Short-lived access tokens
- Encryption of sensitive token data
- Token validation on every request
- Token revocation capabilities

### Credential Security

- Secure credential storage
- Password policy enforcement
- Credential rotation
- Brute force protection

### API Security

- TLS encryption
- Token-based authentication
- Rate limiting
- Input validation

## Implementation Details

### Keycloak Configuration

- Custom themes for branding
- Custom extensions for advanced functionality
- Realm configuration for multi-tenancy
- Client configuration for services

### OpenBao Configuration

- Secret engines for different types of secrets
- Authentication methods for services

- GraphQL API for complex queries
- WebSocket API for real-time updates
- gRPC API for high-performance internal communication

## Conclusion

The IAM architecture provides a comprehensive solution for identity and access management in the Sevensa platform. It ensures that only authenticated and authorized users can access resources, while providing a seamless user experience through single sign-on and self-service capabilities.

The architecture is designed to be scalable, secure, and compliant with industry standards and regulations. It supports the complete identity lifecycle and provides comprehensive audit logging for compliance and security purposes.
