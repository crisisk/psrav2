# /home/vncuser/psra-ltsd-enterprise-v2/docker-compose.override.yml (Keycloak service section only)
# This override file updates the Keycloak service to fix UDP buffer issues, configure single-node mode,
# add proper health checks, and set resource limits. It assumes the base docker-compose.yml has the Keycloak service defined.
services:
  keycloak:
    environment:
      # Configure Keycloak for single-node mode to avoid clustering issues
      - KC_CACHE_STACK=local  # Use local cache stack, no clustering
      - JGROUPS_DISCOVERY_PROTOCOL=none  # Disable JGroups discovery to prevent UDP issues
      # Other Keycloak env vars as needed (e.g., KC_DB_URL, etc.)
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "curl -f http://localhost:8080/health/ready || exit 1"]

        limits:
          memory: 1G  # Limit memory to prevent resource exhaustion
          cpus: '1.0'  # Limit CPU
        reservations:
          memory: 512M  # Reserve memory
          cpus: '0.5'
    # Ensure the container has necessary capabilities or sysctls if needed, but for UDP, we'll handle at host level
    # If using Docker Compose v3.8+, you can add sysctls here, but for simplicity, use the system script
