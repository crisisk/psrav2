# Revised Implementation Plan Based on Sevensa Infrastructure Repository

## Overview

After analyzing the provided Sevensa infrastructure repository, I've revised the implementation plans to align with the existing infrastructure and build upon it. The repository shows an Ansible-based deployment of OpenBao (an open-source HashiCorp Vault alternative) and Keycloak for centralized secret management and identity management, which aligns well with our proposed improvements.

## Current Infrastructure (From Repository)

The repository contains:

1. **Ansible Deployment** for:
   - OpenBao (Vault alternative) for secret management
   - Keycloak for identity and access management
   - Auto-port detection for services
   - Bootstrap scripts for initialization

2. **Docker Compose** configurations for:
   - OpenBao container
   - Keycloak container
   - PostgreSQL database for Keycloak

3. **Secret Management**:
   - OpenBao with KV v2 secret engine
   - Namespaces for multi-tenancy (currently 'sevensa')
   - OIDC integration with Keycloak
   - Python-based import tool for secrets

4. **Identity Management**:
   - Keycloak with realm configuration
   - OIDC client for OpenBao integration

## Revised Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Extend Existing Secret Management & Identity Infrastructure

## Key Differences from Original Plan

1. **Secret Management**: Using OpenBao instead of HashiCorp Vault, leveraging existing setup
2. **Identity Management**: Extending existing Keycloak setup instead of creating a new one
3. **Network Segmentation**: Building on existing infrastructure instead of creating from scratch
4. **Service Integration**: Adapting services to work with OpenBao and Keycloak
5. **Migration Path**: Planning for Kubernetes migration as a separate phase

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve revised implementation plan
2. Begin Phase 1 implementation
3. Develop detailed implementation plans for each phase
4. Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment
5. Implement monitoring and alerting for the implementation process
