# Phase 2: API Server and Frontend Implementation

This document outlines the implementation plan for Phase 2 of the PSRA-LTSD Enterprise v2 platform, focusing on the API server and frontend implementation.

## Overview

Phase 2 builds upon the LangGraph Origin Engine developed in Phase 1, adding a comprehensive API server and user-friendly frontend. This phase will enable users to interact with the platform through a web interface and provide integration capabilities for external systems.

## Components

### API Server

The API server will provide a RESTful interface for interacting with the PSRA-LTSD Enterprise v2 platform, including:

1. **Authentication and Authorization**: User authentication and role-based access control
2. **Origin Calculation**: Endpoints for calculating product origin and preferential status
3. **Product Management**: CRUD operations for products and components
4. **Trade Agreement Management**: Access to trade agreement data and rules
5. **Report Generation**: Generation and retrieval of origin reports
6. **User Management**: User and organization management
7. **Integration**: Webhooks and callbacks for integration with external systems

### Frontend

The frontend will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the platform, including:

1. **Dashboard**: Overview of recent calculations and reports
2. **Product Management**: Interface for managing products and components
3. **Origin Calculation**: Wizard for calculating product origin
4. **Report Viewer**: Interface for viewing and exporting origin reports
5. **Trade Agreement Browser**: Interface for browsing trade agreements and rules
6. **User Management**: Interface for managing users and organizations
7. **Settings**: Configuration options for the platform

## Architecture

The architecture for Phase 2 follows a modern, microservices-based approach:

1. **API Server**: FastAPI-based RESTful API
2. **Frontend**: React-based single-page application
3. **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with Keycloak integration
4. **Database**: PostgreSQL for data storage
5. **Cache**: Redis for caching and session management
6. **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ for asynchronous processing
7. **Storage**: MinIO for file storage

## Implementation Plan

### Week 1-2: API Server Core

1. Set up FastAPI project structure
2. Implement authentication and authorization
3. Design and implement database models
4. Implement core API endpoints
5. Set up testing framework

### Week 3-4: API Server Features

1. Implement product management endpoints
2. Implement trade agreement management endpoints
3. Implement origin calculation endpoints
4. Implement report generation endpoints
5. Implement user management endpoints

### Week 5-6: Frontend Foundation

1. Set up React project structure
2. Implement authentication and authorization
3. Design and implement component library
4. Implement core layouts and navigation
5. Set up testing framework

### Week 7-8: Frontend Features

1. Implement dashboard
2. Implement product management interface
3. Implement origin calculation wizard
4. Implement report viewer
5. Implement trade agreement browser

### Week 9-10: Integration and Testing

1. Integrate API server and frontend
2. Implement end-to-end testing
3. Optimize performance
4. Implement error handling and logging
5. Prepare for deployment

## Deliverables

1. **API Server**: FastAPI-based RESTful API with comprehensive documentation
2. **Frontend**: React-based single-page application with responsive design
3. **Documentation**: API documentation, user guides, and developer documentation
4. **Tests**: Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests
5. **Deployment**: Docker and Kubernetes configurations for deployment

## Technologies

### API Server

- **Framework**: FastAPI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy
- **Authentication**: JWT with Keycloak integration
- **Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger
- **Testing**: pytest

### Frontend

- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit
- **UI Components**: Material-UI
- **Forms**: Formik with Yup validation
- **Testing**: Jest and React Testing Library

## Success Criteria

1. **API Coverage**: 100% of required endpoints implemented and documented
2. **Frontend Coverage**: 100% of required features implemented
3. **Test Coverage**: >80% code coverage for both API server and frontend
4. **Performance**: <100ms response time for API endpoints (excluding origin calculation)
5. **Usability**: Positive feedback from user testing

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Integration challenges with LangGraph Origin Engine | High | Medium | Early integration testing, clear API contracts |
| Performance issues with complex calculations | High | Medium | Implement caching, asynchronous processing |
| Usability challenges with complex workflows | Medium | High | User testing, iterative design |
| Security vulnerabilities | High | Low | Security testing, code reviews |
| Deployment complexity | Medium | Medium | Comprehensive deployment documentation, CI/CD pipeline |

## Next Steps

After completing Phase 2, the platform will be ready for initial user testing and feedback. Phase 3 will focus on multi-tenant architecture and security enhancements.
