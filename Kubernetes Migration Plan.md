## Risk Management

### Identified Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Data loss during migration | High | Low | Perform backups before migration, use a staging environment for testing |
| Service disruption during cutover | High | Medium | Perform cutover during off-hours, have a rollback plan |
| Performance issues after migration | Medium | Medium | Perform load testing before cutover, monitor performance closely |
| Security vulnerabilities | High | Low | Perform security testing, follow Kubernetes security best practices |
| Dependency issues | Medium | Medium | Test all dependencies in a staging environment before migration |

### Contingency Plan

1. **Rollback Plan**: In case of critical issues during or after migration, a rollback plan will be in place to revert to the Docker Compose setup.
2. **Phased Cutover**: The cutover will be performed in phases to minimize risk.
3. **Monitoring**: Enhanced monitoring will be in place during and after migration to quickly identify and address issues.
4. **Support Team**: A dedicated support team will be available during cutover to address any issues.

## Communication Plan

### Stakeholders

| Stakeholder | Communication Frequency | Communication Method |
|-------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Executive Team | Weekly | Status report |
| Service Teams | Daily during migration | Stand-up meeting |
| End Users | Before cutover, during cutover, after cutover | Email, announcement |
| Support Team | Daily during migration | Stand-up meeting |

### Communication Schedule

| Event | Audience | Timing | Method |
|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| Migration Kickoff | All stakeholders | Week 1, Day 1 | Meeting |
| Phase Completion | Executive Team, Service Teams | End of each phase | Status report |
| Cutover Announcement | End Users | 1 week before cutover | Email |
| Cutover Status | All stakeholders | During cutover | Real-time updates |
| Migration Completion | All stakeholders | After successful cutover | Meeting, announcement |

## Success Criteria

The migration will be considered successful when:

1. All services are running in Kubernetes with no critical issues
2. Performance is equal to or better than the Docker Compose setup
3. All functionality is preserved
4. Monitoring and alerting are fully operational
5. Backup and restore procedures are tested and operational
6. Documentation is updated to reflect the new architecture

## Post-Migration Activities

1. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize resource allocation and performance
2. **Documentation Update**: Update all documentation to reflect the new architecture
3. **Training**: Provide training to the team on Kubernetes operations
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Establish a process for continuous improvement of the Kubernetes setup

## Conclusion

This migration plan provides a comprehensive approach to migrating the Sevensa platform from Docker Compose to Kubernetes. By following this plan, the migration can be executed with minimal risk and disruption to services.
