## Technical Approach

### 1. LangGraph Workflow Optimization

#### Current Architecture
The current LangGraph Origin Engine implements a five-step workflow:
1. Initialize
2. Analyze Components
3. Analyze Manufacturing
4. Determine Origin
5. Verify Preferential Status

#### Optimization Strategies
- **Parallel Processing**: Enhance parallel execution of component and manufacturing analyses
- **Graph Restructuring**: Optimize the graph structure for more efficient execution
- **Prompt Engineering**: Refine prompts for more efficient LLM responses
- **Model Selection**: Evaluate and select the most efficient models for each step
- **Batching**: Implement batching for multiple similar calculations

### 2. Advanced Caching Strategies

#### Caching Layers
- **In-Memory Cache**: For frequently accessed calculations
- **Distributed Cache**: Using Redis for shared caching across instances
- **Persistent Cache**: For long-term storage of calculation results

#### Caching Strategies
- **Hierarchical Caching**: Multi-level caching strategy
- **Semantic Caching**: Cache based on semantic similarity of queries
- **Partial Result Caching**: Cache intermediate results for reuse
- **Predictive Caching**: Pre-cache likely calculations based on usage patterns

### 3. Complex Manufacturing Scenarios

#### Scenario Types
- **Multi-Stage Manufacturing**: Support for products with multiple manufacturing stages
- **Substantial Transformation**: Enhanced logic for substantial transformation rules
- **Cumulation**: Support for diagonal, bilateral, and full cumulation
- **De Minimis Rules**: Implementation of de minimis provisions
- **Sets and Assortments**: Special rules for sets and assortments

#### Implementation Approach
- Extend the manufacturing analysis step with specialized sub-steps
- Implement rule-specific logic for different manufacturing scenarios
- Create a flexible framework for adding new manufacturing scenarios

### 4. Specialized Industry Models

#### Automotive Industry
- **Component Classification**: Specialized classification for automotive parts
- **Assembly Rules**: Specific rules for vehicle assembly
- **Regional Value Content**: Industry-specific RVC calculations
- **Tariff Shift Rules**: Specialized tariff shift rules for automotive

#### Electronics Industry
- **Component Classification**: Specialized classification for electronic components
- **Substantial Transformation**: Rules for PCB assembly and programming
- **Minimal Operations**: Industry-specific minimal operations rules
- **Software Consideration**: Rules for software and firmware

#### Textile Industry
- **Yarn-Forward Rules**: Implementation of yarn-forward rules
- **Fabric Formation**: Rules for fabric formation and treatment
- **Cut and Sew Rules**: Implementation of cut and sew provisions
- **Fiber Origin**: Tracking and verification of fiber origin
