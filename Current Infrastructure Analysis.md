# Current Infrastructure Analysis

## Overview

This document provides a detailed analysis of the current Sevensa infrastructure based on the provided repository (`sevensa_infra_repo`). The repository contains an Ansible-based deployment for OpenBao (an open-source alternative to HashiCorp Vault) and Keycloak, which form the foundation of the secret management and identity management infrastructure.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

## Key Components

### 1. OpenBao (Vault Alternative)

OpenBao is deployed as a Docker container and serves as the central secret management solution. It is configured with:

- **Storage**: Raft storage backend for persistence
- **Authentication**: OIDC authentication via Keycloak
- **Namespaces**: Currently configured with a single namespace (`sevensa`)
- **Secret Engines**: KV v2 secret engine for each namespace

The OpenBao container is initialized and unsealed automatically via a bootstrap script. The unseal keys and root token are stored locally in the `/opt/central-vault/openbao/` directory.

### 2. Keycloak

Keycloak is deployed as a Docker container and serves as the identity provider. It is configured with:

- **Database**: PostgreSQL database for persistence
- **Realm**: A single realm (`sevensa`) is configured
- **Client**: A client for OpenBao OIDC authentication (`bao-oidc`)

The Keycloak container is configured to run in development mode, which is not suitable for production.

### 3. Ansible Deployment

The deployment is managed via Ansible with the following components:

- **Inventory**: The target host is defined in `inventory/hosts.ini` (currently set to `147.93.57.40`)
- **Variables**: Default variables are defined in `group_vars/all.yml`
- **Roles**: A single role (`central_vault`) is defined for deploying OpenBao and Keycloak
- **Tasks**: The main tasks include installing dependencies, creating directories, detecting free ports, templating configuration files, and bootstrapping the services

### 4. Docker Compose

The services are deployed using Docker Compose with the following configuration:

- **OpenBao**: The OpenBao container is configured with a Raft storage backend and UI enabled
- **Keycloak**: The Keycloak container is configured with a PostgreSQL database
- **PostgreSQL**: A PostgreSQL container is deployed for Keycloak

### 5. Traefik Configuration

The repository mentions Traefik configuration but does not contain the actual configuration files. The README mentions:

- **Static Config**: `config/traefik.static.yml` (not present in the repository)
- **Dynamic Config**: `config/traefik_dynamic.oauth2.sevensa.yml` (not present in the repository)
- **OAuth2 Proxy**: `compose/oauth2-proxy.compose.yml` (not present in the repository)

### 6. CI/CD

The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow for linting and validating Traefik configuration:

- **Workflow**: `.github/workflows/traefik-lint-validate.yml`
- **Script**: `scripts/validate_traefik.py`

## Current State Analysis

### Strengths

1. **Centralized Secret Management**: OpenBao provides a solid foundation for centralized secret management.
2. **Identity Management**: Keycloak provides a robust identity management solution.
3. **Automation**: The deployment is automated via Ansible, making it repeatable and consistent.
4. **Multi-tenancy**: The infrastructure supports multi-tenancy via namespaces.
5. **OIDC Integration**: OpenBao is integrated with Keycloak via OIDC, providing a unified authentication mechanism.

### Weaknesses

1. **Development Mode**: Keycloak is running in development mode, which is not suitable for production.
2. **Limited Namespaces**: Only a single namespace (`sevensa`) is currently configured.
3. **Basic Secret Engine**: Only the KV v2 secret engine is configured, missing more advanced engines like Transit, PKI, and Database.
4. **Missing Traefik Configuration**: The Traefik configuration is mentioned but not present in the repository.
5. **Limited Network Segmentation**: There is no evidence of network segmentation or micro-segmentation.
6. **No Monitoring or Logging**: There is no centralized monitoring or logging solution.
7. **Security Concerns**: Unseal keys and root token are stored locally, which is a security risk.

### Opportunities

1. **Extend Namespaces**: Add additional namespaces for service isolation (`rentguy`, `psra`, `wpcs`, `ai`).
2. **Configure Advanced Secret Engines**: Implement Transit, PKI, and Database secret engines.
3. **Implement Zero-Trust Network Access**: Implement micro-segmentation with Docker networks.
4. **Deploy Traefik with SSO**: Implement Traefik as the central reverse proxy with OIDC authentication.
5. **Implement Monitoring and Logging**: Deploy Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, and Promtail for monitoring and logging.
6. **Enhance Security**: Implement proper secret management for unseal keys and root token.
7. **Prepare for Kubernetes Migration**: Plan for a future migration to Kubernetes.

## Conclusion

The current infrastructure provides a solid foundation for secret management and identity management but requires significant enhancements to meet the requirements of a production-ready, secure, and scalable platform. The opportunities identified above will be addressed in the revised implementation plan.

## Next Steps

1. Extend the existing OpenBao and Keycloak setup to support all services.
2. Implement Zero-Trust Network Access with Docker networks.
3. Deploy Traefik as the central reverse proxy with OIDC authentication.
4. Implement centralized monitoring and logging.
5. Develop service-specific improvements.
6. Plan for Kubernetes migration.
