## Resource Requirements

The migration will require the following resources:

| Resource | Quantity | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| Kubernetes Nodes | 6 | 3 control plane, 3 worker nodes |
| CPU | 48 cores | Total across all nodes |
| Memory | 192 GB | Total across all nodes |
| Storage | 2 TB | Distributed block storage |
| Network | 1 Gbps | Dedicated network |
| Personnel | 3 | DevOps engineers |

## Risk Management

The following risks have been identified and will be managed throughout the migration:

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Service disruption | High | Medium | Phased migration, rollback plan |
| Data loss | High | Low | Regular backups, data validation |
| Performance degradation | Medium | Medium | Performance testing, optimization |
| Security vulnerabilities | High | Low | Security scanning, RBAC, network policies |
| Resource constraints | Medium | Medium | Capacity planning, resource quotas |

## Success Criteria

The migration will be considered successful when:

1. All services are running on Kubernetes
2. Performance meets or exceeds Docker Compose baseline
3. No security vulnerabilities are introduced
4. Monitoring and logging are fully operational
5. Documentation is complete and up-to-date

## Post-Migration Activities

After the migration, the following activities will be performed:

1. Performance optimization
2. Documentation updates
3. Knowledge transfer
4. Training for operations team
5. Long-term capacity planning

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to migrating the Sevensa platform from Docker Compose to Kubernetes. By following this plan, the migration can be executed with minimal risk and disruption to services.
