## Continuous Improvement

This checklist is a living document and should be updated as the team learns and the project evolves.

### Retrospective Review
- Review checklist effectiveness in sprint retrospectives
- Add new items based on lessons learned
- Remove or modify items that are not valuable

### Quarterly Review
- Conduct a comprehensive review of all checklists
- Align with industry best practices (OWASP, NIST, etc.)
- Update based on new regulatory requirements (EU AI Act updates, etc.)
- Incorporate feedback from security audits or penetration tests

### Metrics to Track
- Percentage of stories meeting DoR before sprint planning
- Percentage of stories fully meeting DoD at sprint end
- Number of production defects that could have been caught by DoD
- Average time to complete DoD items (identify bottlenecks)
- Security finding trends (are we improving?)

## Appendix: Quick Reference

### Critical Path Items (Must Have)
- [ ] All tests passing (unit, integration, E2E)
- [ ] Security scans passed (no critical/high vulnerabilities)
- [ ] Code review approved
- [ ] Documentation updated (acceptance criteria, CHANGELOG)
- [ ] Deployed to staging and smoke tested
- [ ] Rollback procedure tested

### Common Blockers
- Test environment not available → Provision or use testcontainers
- External API credentials missing → Request from Vault/OpenBao admin
- Design not finalized → Schedule design review meeting
- Dependency on another team → Establish coordination channel

### Escalation Path
1. Team lead / Scrum master (immediate blockers)
2. Product owner (requirements clarification)
3. Security champion (security questions)
4. DevOps lead (infrastructure / deployment issues)
5. CTO / Engineering manager (strategic decisions)
