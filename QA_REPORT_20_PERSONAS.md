## Conclusion

The PSRA-LTSD Enterprise v2 application shows promise with a clean architecture and thoughtful design system. However, several critical issues prevent it from being production-ready:

1. **Authentication is completely missing** - This is a security showstopper
2. **Core CTA functionality is broken** - Users cannot perform key actions
3. **Many features are incomplete** - Export, approval workflows, search, etc.
4. **Accessibility is poor** - Will struggle to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
5. **Demo site is incomplete** - Cannot effectively demo to prospects

**Recommended Priority:**
1. Fix critical bugs (P0) - Week 1
2. Implement authentication - Week 1-2
3. Complete CTA functionality - Week 2-3
4. Add export functionality - Week 3-4
5. Improve accessibility - Weeks 4-6
6. Complete demo site - Week 4
7. Add search and filters - Weeks 5-6

With focused effort over the next 6-8 weeks, the application could reach production-ready state. The foundation is solid, but significant work remains to complete the feature set and ensure security, accessibility, and usability.
